This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Validasaur.
These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to
propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Process of issue filing

Check if there is an existing issue covering your intention.

1. If you have the same problem but the outcome is different (or vice versa), add a comment stating the difference.
2. If you have the exact same problem add a like (:+1:).
3. Otherwise you can create a new issue.

### Bugs

When facing a bug, give steps to reproduce as well as the error. If you have a hypothesis to why this issue erupted, mention this. If you have already isolated the issue and have found a fix, you can open a PR.

### Ideas

Ideas are welcome, and if there is a good reason and/or many users agree, there is a good chance it will be incorporated. Before making a PR, get feedback from the maintainers and community.

### Questions

If you can't find the answers in one of the open (or closed) issues, you can create a new one.

## When creating a PR

Before pushing commits, go through this checklist:

* You have run `deno fmt`.
* All tests are running successfully locally (will save you time).

For a PR to be accepted, the following needs to be applied:

* Every function added, must have corresponding test.
* Pipeline is green.
* Nothing more than what the PR is supposed to solve is changed (unless discussed and approved).
